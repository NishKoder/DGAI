# Demystify Generative AI

“Technology advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic.”

--Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey)


## A simple introduction to generative AI for people without computer science background.

A 16-chapter series to introduce generative AI on how to generate images, text, music, figures, patterns, and more. The series show how to:

* Create a ChatGPT-style large language model from scratch to generate text that can pass as human-written.
* Generate images that are indistinguishable from real photos
* Compose music that anyone would think it’s real
* Create patterns such as a sequence of odd numbers, or numbers that are multiples of five
* Generate data that mimic certain shapes: sine curve, cosine shape, hyperbola graph
* Control the latent space to generate images with certain attributes: men with glasses, women with glasses, transitioning gradually from men with glasses to men without glasses, or from women without glases to women with glasses...
* Style transfer: convert an horse image to a zebra...
